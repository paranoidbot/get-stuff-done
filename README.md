This is a simple full-stack to-do app written using the Laravel framework, a MySQl database and a touch of Bootstrap for some style points.

To use it, simply clone the project in a directory of your choice and make your web server point it. Use the .env.example file to see your connection options and the composer.json to see the php requirements.

Feel free to use the code in whatever way you like.
